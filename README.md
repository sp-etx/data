# ETx data handling repository

## Getting started (as of 2015-04-29)

Use Python 3. It's the best for data handling, not least because Unicode is finally done right.

`requirements.txt` should contain a list of the necessary Python requirements. Start by doing
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and if something fails, perhaps download binaries from Chris Gohlke: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/


## What it contains (as of 2015-04-29)

* `clean_data` is an iPython notebook for cleaning up some data from Göteborg Energi, Svenska Kraftnät and Nord Pool
* `gbg_model` is an iPython notebook for preparing some data for a Gothenburg energy system model
